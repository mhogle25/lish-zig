//! Finds where an embedded lish expression ends.
//!
//! Hosts that splice lish into their own syntax need the same answer: given the
//! text right after an opening delimiter, where is the terminator that closes
//! it — skipping any terminator that sits inside a string, a comment, or a
//! nested bracket pair? folio's `{...}` regions and the macro grammar's `|...|`
//! bodies both ask this. This is the single place that answers it.
//!
//! It mirrors `lexer.zig`'s string and comment rules exactly; the corpus in
//! `src/scanner_corpus/` pins the two together so they can't drift.
//!
//! Streaming embedders (tree-sitter external scanners) can't call this — they
//! receive input one codepoint at a time and have no buffer to pass. They keep
//! their own scan, held to the same corpus.
